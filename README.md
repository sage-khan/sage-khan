## Open For Business: Harnessing the Power of Open Source in Corporate World

October 2025
Book
Taylor & Francis

Abstract: Open for Business by Sage Khan & Rahim Ali explores the transformative role of open-source software in the corporate landscape. It examines the evolution of software licensing, from the early days of copyright and proprietary models, championed by figures like Bill Gates, to the rise of open-source principles driven by the Free Software Foundation and the GNU Project. The book explores how open-source projects, supported by the Linux Foundation, have become integral to modern IT infrastructure, promoting innovation, security, and cost efficiency. It highlights the growing specialization in fields like DevOps, AI, and cybersecurity, and discusses the challenges companies face in maintaining in-house expertise, often leading to outsourcing for convenience. Khan critically assesses the impact of corporate intervention on open-source projects, using case studies of Red Hat, HashiCorp, and others to illustrate how business decisions can sometimes undermine the open-source ethos. Despite these challenges, the book highlights the resilience of the open-source community through initiatives such as project forks and alternative licensing models. ”Open for Business” advocates for the adoption of open-source solutions to enhance organizational learning and flexibility while balancing corporate needs for scalability and support. It calls for a renewed commitment to the principles of transparency, collaboration, and freedom in the software industry. DOI: 10.1201/9781003536314. ISBN: 9781003536314.

## IOT-based Smart Building Management

21 Apr 2025
Research Paper
SES Journal, Zenodo DOI

Abstract: A Dual Approach to Automation and Safety with Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts - The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into building management systems has revolutionized the development of smarter, more efficient and safer environments. This paper presents a dual approach to smart building management, emphasizing both automation and safety through real-time monitoring and alert mechanisms. The automation system utilizes bidirectional ultrasonic sensors to monitor building occupancy and, in conjunction with temperature sensors, dynamically adjusts appliances such as lights, fans, air conditioners, and heaters to optimize comfort and energy efficiency. A notable feature of the system is its ability to enable remote monitoring and control of appliances via SMS communication. On the safety front, the system incorporates a suite of IoT sensors including smoke, flame, gas, temperature, and ultrasonic sensors to detect hazards such as fires or gas leaks. In response to such events, the system automatically disconnects circuit breakers, activates alarms for evacuation, and dispatches real-time alert messages to occupants’ mobile devices. This dual-function system enhances operational efficiency, reduces energy consumption, and significantly improves building safety. The paper details the design, implementation, and practical benefits of this integrated IoT-based smart building management solution. ISSN (e) 3007-3138 (p) 3007-312X

## Leveraging AI in Pharmacy & Clinical Pharmacy Transformative

07 May 2025
Review Paper
SES Journal, DOI

Abstract: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence in Pharmacy and Clinical Pharmacy Transformative Innovations for Precision, Operational Efficiency, and Enhanced Patient-Centered Care covers that By improving accuracy, operational effectiveness, and patient-centered care, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical pharmacy and pharmacy is transforming healthcare. Drug discovery, customized medicine, and pharmaceutical treatment management are being optimized by AI-driven advances, including machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. AI-powered decision support systems in clinical pharmacies increase workflow efficiency, decrease adverse medication reactions, and improve prescription accuracy. Real-time patient monitoring, AI-assisted drug use evaluations, and automated dispensing robots all help to optimize resources and enhance therapeutic results. Additionally, AI improves drug adherence through digital health interventions such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and smartphone apps that offer instructional help and customized reminders. Drug safety surveillance is strengthened by the early detection of adverse drug responses made possible by the incorporation of AI in pharmacovigilance. Despite these developments, competent AI implementation requires addressing issues including data protection, legal compliance, and ethical considerations. This paper examines how artificial intelligence (AI) is changing pharmacy and clinical pharmacy, highlighting significant advancements, advantages, and difficulties, as well as how it might change the way healthcare is delivered. Pharmacists may adopt a more proactive, data-driven strategy by utilizing AI, which will eventually enhance patient safety, treatment results, and healthcare efficiency. To enable AI’s responsible and successful incorporation into pharmacy practice, future research should concentrate on improving AI algorithms, encouraging multidisciplinary cooperation, and creating strong regulatory frameworks. To satisfy the changing needs of precision medicine and patient-centric healthcare, this study emphasizes the critical necessity for ongoing developments in AI-driven pharmacy solutions.

## Code-Switched Urdu ASR for Noisy Telephonic Environment

Jul 2023
Research Paper
Arxiv,S2IS

Abstract: Call Centers have huge amount of audio data, which can be used for achieving valuable business insights and transcription of phone calls is a tedious task when done manually. An effective Automated Speech Recognition system can accurately transcribe these calls for easy search through call history for specific context and content, allowing automatic call monitoring, improving QoS through keyword search and sentiment analysis. ASR for Call Center requires more robustness as the telephonic environment are generally noisy. Moreover, there are many low-resourced languages that are on verge of extinction, which can be preserved with the help of Automatic Speech Recognition Technology. Urdu is the 10th most widely spoken language in the world, with 231,295,440 worldwide, still remains a resource constrained language in ASR. Regional call-center conversations operate in the local language, with a mix of English numbers and technical terms generally causing code-switching problem. Hence, this paper describes an implementation framework of a resource-efficient Automatic Speech Recognition/ Speech to Text System in a noisy call-center environment using Chain Hybrid HMM and CNN-TDNN for Code-Switched Urdu Language. Using Hybrid HMM-DNN approach allowed us to utilize the advantages of Neural Network with less labelled data. Adding CNN with TDNN has been shown to work better in a noisy environment due to CNN’s additional frequency dimension, which captures extra information from noisy speech, thus improving accuracy. We collected data from various open sources and labelled some of the unlabelled data after analysing its general context and content from Urdu language as well as from commonly used words from other languages, primarily English and were able to achieve WER of 5.2% with noisy as well as clean environment in isolated words or numbers as well as in continuous spontaneous speech.
